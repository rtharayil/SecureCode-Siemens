# **Secure by Default**

## **Definition**
**Secure by Default** is a software design principle that ensures systems and applications are secure right out of the box, with secure configurations as the default. Developers must explicitly opt out of secure settings rather than opting in.

## **Key Principles of Secure by Default**
1. **Minimal Attack Surface:** Disable unnecessary services or features by default.
2. **Secure Configuration:** Default settings prioritize security (e.g., HTTPS over HTTP).
3. **Secure Communication:** Use encryption by default.
4. **Authentication and Authorization:** Enable strong authentication mechanisms.
5. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
