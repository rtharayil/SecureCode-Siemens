# **Scenario 2: Secure Medical Data Encryption Using Public Key Cryptography**  

## **Objective**  
Encrypt sensitive patient data securely before transmitting it to the doctor via email . The doctor decrypts the data using her private key.  

## **Steps**  

1. **Generate RSA Key Pair:**  
   - Create a pair of RSA keys (private and public) for secure communication.  

2. **Data Encryption:**  
   - Encrypt patient data with the doctor's public key 

3. **Data Decrypts:**  
   - Additionally, build a console app for the doctor to securely decrypt the data using this private key
