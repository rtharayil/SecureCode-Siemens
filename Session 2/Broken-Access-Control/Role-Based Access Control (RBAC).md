Implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for an API that accesses, modifies, and deletes patient radiology reports is critical to ensure data security, privacy, and compliance with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR. Below is a detailed breakdown of roles, permissions, and how to structure the API to enforce RBAC.

---

### **Roles and Permissions**

1. **Radiologist**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access and view radiology reports.
     - **Create:** Upload new radiology reports.
     - **Update:** Modify existing radiology reports (e.g., add annotations, corrections).
     - **Delete:** Delete radiology reports (with restrictions, e.g., only if no associated treatment exists).
   - **Description:**
     - Radiologists are responsible for creating, interpreting, and updating radiology reports. They need full access to radiology data but may have restrictions on deletion to maintain data integrity.

2. **Physician (Referring Doctor)**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access and view radiology reports for their patients.
     - **Update:** Add comments or notes to radiology reports (but not modify the original report).
     - **Cannot:** Create or delete radiology reports.
   - **Description:**
     - Physicians need access to radiology reports to make informed treatment decisions. They can add comments but cannot alter the original report or delete it.

3. **Lab Technician**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access radiology reports (limited to specific fields, e.g., imaging metadata).
     - **Update:** Update imaging metadata (e.g., scan parameters, timestamps).
     - **Cannot:** Create or delete radiology reports.
   - **Description:**
     - Lab technicians manage imaging equipment and metadata. They have limited access to radiology reports and cannot create or delete them.

4. **Administrator**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access all radiology reports.
     - **Create:** Upload radiology reports (in rare cases, e.g., manual uploads).
     - **Update:** Modify any radiology report.
     - **Delete:** Delete any radiology report.
   - **Description:**
     - Administrators have full access to manage radiology reports, including creating, updating, and deleting them. They are responsible for system maintenance and data integrity.

5. **Patient**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access their own radiology reports.
     - **Cannot:** Create, update, or delete radiology reports.
   - **Description:**
     - Patients can view their own radiology reports but cannot modify or delete them.

6. **Billing Staff**
   - **Permissions:**
     - **Read:** Access radiology reports (limited to billing-related information, e.g., procedure codes).
     - **Cannot:** Create, update, or delete radiology reports.
   - **Description:**
     - Billing staff need access to radiology reports for billing and insurance purposes but have no permissions to modify or delete them.

### **API Endpoint Design with RBAC**

Below is an example of how to design API endpoints to enforce RBAC for radiology reports:

#### **1. Get Radiology Report**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`
- **Permissions:**
  - Radiologist, Physician, Lab Technician, Administrator, Patient (only their own reports), Billing Staff.
- **Logic:**
  - Check the user's role and ensure they have access to the requested report.
  - Patients can only access their own reports.

#### **2. Create Radiology Report**
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/radiology-reports`
- **Permissions:**
  - Radiologist, Administrator.
- **Logic:**
  - Only radiologists and administrators can create new radiology reports.

#### **3. Update Radiology Report**
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`
- **Permissions:**
  - Radiologist (full update), Physician (add comments only), Lab Technician (update metadata only), Administrator.
- **Logic:**
  - Radiologists and administrators can update any field.
  - Physicians can only add comments.
  - Lab technicians can only update metadata.

#### **4. Delete Radiology Report**
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`
- **Permissions:**
  - Radiologist (with restrictions), Administrator.
- **Logic:**
  - Radiologists can only delete reports if no associated treatment exists.
  - Administrators can delete any report.

#### **5. List Radiology Reports**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/radiology-reports`
- **Permissions:**
  - Radiologist, Physician (only their patients), Administrator, Patient (only their own reports), Billing Staff.
- **Logic:**
  - Filter results based on the user's role and permissions.

### **RBAC Enforcement in the API**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use a token-based authentication system (e.g., JWT) to identify users and their roles.
   - Include the user's role in the token payload.

2. **Middleware for Role Validation:**
   - Implement middleware to validate the user's role before processing each request.
   - Example (pseudo-code):
     ```python
     def role_required(allowed_roles):
         def decorator(func):
             def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
                 user_role = request.user.role
                 if user_role not in allowed_roles:
                     return Response("Unauthorized", status=403)
                 return func(request, *args, **kwargs)
             return wrapper
         return decorator
     ```

3. **Data Filtering:**
   - For endpoints like `GET /api/radiology-reports`, filter results based on the user's role.
   - Example:
     - A physician should only see reports for their patients.
     - A patient should only see their own reports.

4. **Audit Logs:**
   - Log all access and modifications to radiology reports for auditing purposes.
   - Include details like user ID, role, timestamp, and action performed.

### **Example API Flow**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - A user logs in and receives a JWT token with their role (e.g., `role: "radiologist"`).

2. **Accessing a Radiology Report:**
   - The user makes a `GET` request to `/api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`.
   - The API checks the user's role and permissions:
     - If the user is a radiologist, physician, or administrator, allow access.
     - If the user is a patient, ensure the report belongs to them.

3. **Updating a Radiology Report:**
   - A radiologist makes a `PUT` request to `/api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`.
   - The API validates the user's role and allows the update.

4. **Deleting a Radiology Report:**
   - An administrator makes a `DELETE` request to `/api/radiology-reports/{reportId}`.
   - The API validates the user's role and allows the deletion.

---

### **Security Considerations**

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt radiology reports at rest and in transit (e.g., using TLS for API communication).

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks or malformed data.

4. **Regular Audits:**
   - Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with regulations and identify vulnerabilities.

By implementing RBAC in your API, you can ensure that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete radiology reports, while maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.
